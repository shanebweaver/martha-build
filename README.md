# How To: Martha Grow Tent for Fruiting Mushrooms
By: Shane Weaver

I've been getting into mushroom cultivation lately, starting as a hobby but with potential to start a business. I like the idea of being a mushroom cultivator, but like most people I don't have any formal education on the topic. I don't even remembering them being a topic in gradeschool. So to get a feel for it, I decided to try my hand at growing something.

Right off the bat I bought a Oyster mushroom box from Home Depot for $20, followed the instructions (incorrectly), and managed to grow some blue-green mold... but no mushrooms. Time to double down!

Turns out there is more than one way to fruit a mushroom. I've seen amazing variety in grow tent design across Shroomery and the wide web, with some being better than others. However, I couldn't quite find any guides that met my particular style of over-doing things.

Thus, after many hours of YouTube and scrolling through forums, I identified a few trends: There seems to be a lot of love out there for the Martha style tent from small growers. I also noticed strong support for House of Hydro humidity systems from commercial growers. So that is what I built. Let's dive in!

## Tent Placement

Picking a place to put your tent is important. There are a few factors to consider:

- **Temperature**   
    Choose a location that has relatively stable temperature throughout the day. Big sudden swings in temperature are bad. I chose a spare bedroom that doesn't get a lot of foot traffic, so the door stays shut.

- **Humidity**  
    Maintaining humidity is a big factor in the Martha style tent. Similar to temperature, pick a location that has relatively stable ambient humidity.

- **Fresh Air Exchange (FAE)**
    The fresh air coming into the tent needs to be clean/filtered. Since my tent is in a closed room, I simply use the ambient air in the room, provided by the central HVAC system, which is HEPA filtered.

- **Exhaust**   
    Some mushroom spores can cause alergic type reactions, so it's important to ventilate to the outside, and not into your house. Pick a room that has a window, or where you are comfortable cutting a hole in the wall for exhaust ventilation.

- **Noise**     
    The system makes a minor level of noise as it operates. Mostly just the sounds of moving air and bubbling water. Be cautious if sharing a wall with a bedroom or office.

- **Light**     
    Mushrooms enjoy a regular day-night cycle for fruiting. Place the tent in an area that allows for 12 hours cycles of light/dark.

- **Water (optional)**
    If you have the option, consider placing the tent near a water line, or running a dedicated line to your tent location. This allows for the humidifier to be adapted with an auto-fill valve, for a set and forget type setup. I did not do this initially, but will be upgrading later.
