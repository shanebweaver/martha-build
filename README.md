# How To: Build a Martha Grow Tent for Fruiting Mushrooms
*By: Shane Weaver*

I've been getting into mushroom cultivation lately, starting as a hobby but with potential to start a business. I like the idea of being a mushroom cultivator, but like most people I don't have any formal education on the topic. I don't even remember them being a topic in gradeschool. So to get a feel for it, I decided to try my hand at growing something.

Right off the bat I bought a Oyster mushroom box from Home Depot for $20, followed the instructions (incorrectly), and managed to grow some blue-green mold... but no mushrooms. Time to double down!

Turns out there is more than one way to fruit a mushroom. I've seen amazing variety in grow tent design across Shroomery and the wide web, with some being better than others. However, I couldn't quite find any guides that met my particular style of over-doing things.

Thus, after many hours of YouTube and scrolling through forums, I identified a few trends: There seems to be a lot of love out there for the Martha style tent from small growers. I also noticed strong support for House of Hydro humidity systems from commercial growers. So that is what I built. Let's dive in!

## Tent Placement

Picking a place to put your tent is important. There are a few factors to consider:

- **Temperature**   
    Choose a location that has relatively stable temperature throughout the day. Big sudden swings in temperature are bad. I chose a spare bedroom that doesn't get a lot of foot traffic, so the door stays shut.

- **Humidity**  
    Maintaining humidity is a big factor in the Martha style tent. Similar to temperature, pick a location that has relatively stable ambient humidity.

- **Fresh Air Exchange (FAE)**
    The fresh air coming into the tent needs to be clean/filtered. Since my tent is in a closed room, I simply use the ambient air in the room, provided by the central HVAC system, which is HEPA filtered.

- **Exhaust**   
    Some mushroom spores can cause alergic type reactions, so it's important to ventilate to the outside, and not into your house. Pick a room that has a window, or where you are comfortable cutting a hole in the wall for exhaust ventilation.

- **Noise**     
    The system makes a minor level of noise as it operates. Mostly just the sounds of moving air and bubbling water. Be cautious if sharing a wall with a bedroom or office.

- **Light**     
    Mushrooms enjoy a regular day-night cycle for fruiting. Place the tent in an area that allows for 12 hours cycles of light/dark.

- **Water (optional)**
    If you have the option, consider placing the tent near a water line, or running a dedicated line to your tent location. This allows for the humidifier to be adapted with an auto-fill valve, for a set and forget type setup. I did not do this initially, but will be upgrading later.

## Shopping list

To build this Martha, I used parts from Amazon, Home Depot, and the House of Hydro. Note, some things like fans can be substituted with similar parts. It doesn't have to be exact.

### Greenhouse

My core tent consists of the Martha tent itself, a plastic base, and a shallow perlite tray. The plastic base is for catching any condensation or dripping water, and the smaller perlite tray is for humidity control.

- Tent: [Gardman R687 4-Tier Mini Greenhouse, 27" Long x 18" Wide x 63" High](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCTGQE)
- Base tray: [MidWest Homes for Pets Dog Crate Replacement Pans, 30-Inch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DHW10)
- Perlite tray: [MidWest Homes for Pets Dog Crate Replacement Pans, 18-Inch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TU7PM0)

### Lighting

Mushrooms recognize a day cycle to indicate fruiting conditions. This can be simulated with a T5 florescent lamp and a timed power strip. We'll need rope to suspend the light as well.

- T5 light: [Hydrofarm Agrobrite FLT22 T5 Fluorescent Grow Light System, 2 Foot, 2 Tube](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0031CA3OM)
- Timed outlet: [Century 8 Outlet Surge Protector with Mechanical Timer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MWHQZX0)
- Grow light rope: [Apollo Horticulture Stainless Steel 1/8" Adjustable Grow Light Rope Hanger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M398UJ4) 

### Humidifier

Perhaps the most important and costly aspect of this build is the humidity system. Hands down House of Hydro has the best gear for building a custom humidifier. I picked up the mist maker, humidistat, and humidity controller as well. Most everything else can be picked up at a hardware store (or Amazon).

- Ultrasonic mist maker: [3 Disc Mist Maker Starter Kit w/ Tuff Coat + 2x warranty](https://www.thehouseofhydro.com/store/p83/3_Disc_Mist_Maker_Starter_Kit_.html)
- Humidistat: [Auto Humidity Controller, Humidistat, Greenhouse Controller](https://www.thehouseofhydro.com/store/p94/Auto_Humidity_Controller%2C_Humidistat%2C_Greenhouse_Controller.html)
- Mist output controller: [Mist output Control for the 3-12 Disc Mist Makers](https://www.thehouseofhydro.com/store/p92/Mist_output_Control_for_the_3-12_Disc_Mist_Makers.html)
- Water resevoir: [17 Gal. Tough Storage Tote in Black](https://www.homedepot.com/p/HDX-17-Gal-Tough-Storage-Tote-in-Black-SH17GTOUGHTLDBY/205808350)
- Muffin fan: [AC Infinity AXIAL 1238, Muffin Fan, 115V 120V AC 120mm x 38mm High Speed](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OWRMZ6)
- Muffin fan controller: [AC Infinity, Fan Speed Controller for 100 to 125V AC Axial Muffin Cooling Fans, Single Connector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00809BQZG)
- Cable extension splitter: [Cablelera Power Cord Extension and Splitter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FRODUR4)
- PVC flange, 4-inch
- PVC pipe, 4-inch
- Clear silicone sealant

### Heating

For heating, I have a simple seedling heating mat and thermostat controller.

- Thermostat controller: [WILLHI WH1436A Temperature Controller 110V Digital Thermostat Switch Sous Vide Controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V4TJR00)
- Heating mat: [VIVOSUN Durable Waterproof Seedling Heat Mat Warm Hydroponic Heating Pad 10" x 20.75" MET Standard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P7U259C)

### Exhaust

To promote fresh air exchange (FAE), I added an inline fan to my exhaust tubing. This is used to help dial in the temperature/humidity/FAE balance.

- Inline fan: [4" Inline Fan - 188 CFM Exhaust Duct Fan, Built-in Speed Controller, ETL Listed, Pre-Wired 6 FT Grounded Cord](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X3VDXVF)

### Control station

This setup involves quite a few wires and devices to keep track of. To organize the madness, and get the devices off the ground, I zip-tied it all to a plastic crate. The devices are attached atop, while the cords are fed through the holes and bound neatly within. Get creative, find what works for you and your space.

### Miscellaneous

Other parts less notable include:

- 4-inch ventilation ducting
- 2 x 4-inch ventilation defusers
- Duct tape
- Screws + wingnuts
